## wget: Setting Download Method to "wget -c"


`r badger::badge_license("Artistic-2.0")`
`r badger::badge_github_version("YuLab-SMU/wget", "blue")`
`r badger::badge_cran_release('wget', 'green')`
`r badger::badge_cran_download('wget', 'grand-total', 'green')`



```{r comment="", echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(packageDescription('wget')$Description)
```


What you need is to run the `wget::wget_set()` function. Then `download.file()`, `install.packages()` and `BiocManager::install()` will all support continue retrival.
